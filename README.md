# OSTEP - Operating Systems - Three Easy Pieces
Welcome to this repo! This contains my code as I work through the OSTEP (Operating Systems - Three Easy Pieces) by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau. It is split into the chapter sections as well as the associated projects and my solutions to them. The README and this repo will be updated as I work through everything.
